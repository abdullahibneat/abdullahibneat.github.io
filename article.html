		<p>I was approached by the client, EasyFX, in early December with a brief involving the renovation of the branding as well as a website to advertise their trading packages.</p>

		<p>Starting from the original logo and the brief, I begun to design the new logo. After numerous iterations, involving suggestions and feedback from the client, the design was of satisfaction of the client, and I was able to proceed on the website design.</p>

		<p>The client sent me some examples of designs he liked, and as such I was able to collect common design features and develop a website based on those elements. However, one week later the client changed the specification, requiring me to restart the development from scratch. I was sent new example websites, and the development took two weeks, including testing, optimization, and iterations based on client feedback. I then setup the domain name, hosting, custom email address and configure settings to prevent attacks on the website.</p>

		<p>The website met all requirements, and the website went live soon afterwards at the web address easyfx1.net.</p>

		<p>Through this project, I strengthened my CSS and JavaScript skills, learning new styling techniques and JavaScript methods. I also learnt how important it is to keep a constant communication with the client to ensure the client needs and expectations are met, as well as to be prepared for unexpected changes.</p>
