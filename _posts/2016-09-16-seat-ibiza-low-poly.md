*3D Model made using **3DS Max** by following a blueprint.â€‹*

I started off by placing a plane on the side of the car, and by using edge extrusion I created the body of the car. I used the cut tool in order to shape the windows, and the extrude tool for the headlights and the bumper. Then, by manipulating vertices and edges, I shaped the car. I also used the material editor to apply the colours. In the end I used the turbosmooth modifier to smooth the edges. I also used keyframe animation with some lighting to create an animation.
